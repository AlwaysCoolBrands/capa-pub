## 3. Root Cause Analysis

### Problem Statement
```markdown
Authentication service failures caused by database connection pool exhaustion, resulting in users unable to log in to the system.
```

### Five Whys Analysis
```markdown
Problem: Authentication service failures preventing user logins

1. Why? Service returning 500 errors
   - Evidence: Error logs showing connection timeouts
   - Response: Database connection pool was exhausted

2. Why? Database connection pool exhausted
   - Evidence: Monitoring showing max connections reached
   - Response: Pool size insufficient for current load

3. Why? Pool size insufficient
   - Evidence: Growth metrics showing 40% increase in users
   - Response: Capacity planning didn't account for recent growth

4. Why? Growth not accounted for
   - Evidence: Capacity review docs from 6 months ago
   - Response: No automated scaling or regular capacity reviews

5. Why? No automated management
   - Evidence: System configuration docs
   - Response: Original design assumed static pool size

Root Cause: Lack of automated connection pool management and regular capacity planning led to system unable to handle organic growth.
```

### Contributing Factors
```markdown
1. Primary Factors
   - Static Pool Configuration
     * Evidence: System configuration files
     * Impact: Unable to handle load spikes
   - Insufficient Monitoring
     * Evidence: Alert configuration
     * Impact: Late detection of issue

2. Secondary Factors
   - Manual Scaling Process
     * Evidence: Operations runbook
     * Impact: Slower response time
   - Documentation Gaps
     * Evidence: Incomplete runbooks
     * Impact: Delayed troubleshooting
```

## 4. Impact Analysis

### Customer Impact
```markdown
1. Direct Impact
   - Number of customers: 150
   - Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes
   - Severity: Critical (S1)
   - Nature of impact: Unable to access services

2. Indirect Impact
   - Downstream effects: Delayed business operations
   - Long-term implications: Customer trust impact
```

### System Impact
```markdown
1. Technical Impact
   - Systems affected: Authentication service, API gateway
   - Services disrupted: All authenticated endpoints
   - Data integrity: No data loss or corruption

2. Operational Impact
   - Process disruptions: Manual intervention required
   - Resource utilization: High CPU during recovery
   - Performance effects: Increased latency during recovery
```

## 5. Evidence Collection

### Technical Evidence
```markdown
1. System Logs
   - Auth Service: High error rate, connection timeouts
   - Database: Connection pool exhaustion, retry storms
   - Load Balancer: 500 error increase

2. Monitoring Data
   - Connection Pool Usage: 100% utilization
   - Error Rate: Peaked at 75%
   - Response Time: >5s during incident

3. Technical Analysis
   - Load Testing: Confirmed pool size issue
   - Capacity Analysis: System undersized by 40%
```

### Process Evidence
```markdown
1. Documentation Review
   - Runbook gaps identified
   - Missing scaling procedures
   - Outdated capacity plans

2. Interview Findings
   - Operations: Monitoring gaps identified
   - Development: Growth planning needed
   - Support: Communication delays noted
```

## 6. Initial Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Break Fix)
```markdown
1. Increase Connection Pool Size
   - Description: Adjust to handle current load
   - Justification: Prevent immediate recurrence
   - Timeline: Implement within 24 hours

2. Add Pool Monitoring
   - Description: Configure alerts at 70% utilization
   - Justification: Earlier warning of issues
   - Timeline: Implement within 48 hours
```

### Long-term Improvements
```markdown
1. Process Changes
   - Implement automated scaling
   - Regular capacity reviews
   - Update runbooks

2. System Enhancements
   - Dynamic pool sizing
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - Automated failover
```
